Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
This is the course project for the week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R does:

	1.	Set the wd and load the libraries needed.
	2.	Load the raw data (activity and feature info as well as training and test datasets).
	3.	Cleaning the datasets
	4.	Merging the datasets.
	5.	Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
	6.	Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
